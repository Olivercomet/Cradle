=== CRADLE ===

Work in progress file viewer for Clock Tower (SNES).


[This is a project I started a long time ago, and has only recently been resurrected.
Elements are still in the process of being ported from another platform (namely, Unity).
Some features may therefore not work as intended.]



Current features:

Decompresses room graphics and displays them. (However, some rooms will cause an exception, and some others will not display properly.)
Allows you to view information about the object in a room.
Compatible with translated roms (Aeon Genesis etc.)
Dialogue viewer.
Rando tracker.


With thanks to MegamanEXE95 on TCRF, for his invaluable mapping out of large sections of the rom and documenting the sprite/animation formats.
